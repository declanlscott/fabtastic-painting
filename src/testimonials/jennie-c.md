title: Jennie's Testimonial
author: Jennie C.
content: Andrea and Angela were so NEAT! And PROFESSIONAL! They completely painted and removed from a previous paint job splattered turquoise paint off the brown wood trim and white edge of the shower. They neatly re-caulked my garden tub. The clean up afterwards was IMPECCABLE!
