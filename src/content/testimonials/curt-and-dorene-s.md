title: Curt and Dorene's Testimonial
author: Curt and Dorene S.
content: Fabtastic Painting was suggested by a friend so I called to get an estimate. They were quick to return my call..came and looked at job within a few days and I had their bid in 48 hours. Remembering spring and all the rain we had, they still completed our job on time and it looks wonderful. They gave me some awesome ideas that I used and painted our small bathroom for free as a bonus for using their company. Korey and Andrea are wonderful, warm people and their employees are the same. My husband and I have made new friends for life and highly recommend Fabtastic Painting.
